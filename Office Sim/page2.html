<p>"Sorry, I've got a lot of work to catch up on." You say very seriously, motioning over to your screen. It was an excel sheet with numbers
    that didn't actually represent anything. You just wanted to fill it out to look like you've been keeping track of <em>something.</em>
    Thankfully Pazy doesn't seem to notice. Her smile falls immediately and she walks away, mumbling a short apology for interrupting. Somehow you feel as if you've dodged a major bullet.

    When she was officially out of sight, your coworker Mosy pokes his head over. "Good job. She's been going up to everyone all day. Says her mom
    is sick and she needs help with that big Oklamoha report Bauss tasked her with. If you ask me, I think she's scrambling to finish it because Bauss is 
    getting tired of waiting, and the sick mom is just a lie to guilt trip someone into saying yes." It wasn't out of the realm of possibility considering how infamous Pazy was for her worth ethic. 
    In fact, the office had created a nickname for her, "Lazy Pazy", because of how little she seemed
    to actually do.
