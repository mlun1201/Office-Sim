<p>"Umm," you hesitate for a second, before figuring you could at least hear her out. "Yeah, sure. What's up Pazy?"</p>
<p>Pazy visibly brightens up. "Oh, great! Everyone else has been too busy, so I was worried you'd turn me down too." Suddenly
    you felt as if you've made the wrong choice. She continued, "Sooo Bauss just told me I needed to get the Oklamoha report done
    and emailed to him by the end of next week," She wasn't going to ask what you thought, right? "But the problem is I need to see
    my mom over the weekend. She was just diagnosed with, um," You watch as she struggled to identify (or make up) the illness before 
    she sighed "Well the important part is she's very sick and needs me to take care of her while my sisters gets ready to move and take over
    watching her fulltime"."
</p>
<p>
    You stare at her.
</p>
<p>
    "Anyways, all this to say I need help completing the report. I've already asked for an extension twice, so Bauss probably won't give me 
    grace again. I really need your help."
