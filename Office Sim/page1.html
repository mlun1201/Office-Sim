<p>You're the kind of person that does the bare minimum at work. Within the confines of your small cubicle, you spend work days online browsing, making origami animals, or occasionally staring at a blank excel sheet when someone
    important is nearby. It's peaceful. Currently you're deleting spam emails cluttering up your storage. You skim over the subject lines with minimal interest before one catches your eye. </p>
<div class="blink_me">
